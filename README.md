#Project Plan:
* Project Plan
For our Fall 2020 Intro to web development group project we have decided to create a website called Sports Spot. 

This website hosts a variety of sports contents. Individuals will be able to browse sports news, sports facts, upcoming seasons, 
sessions league stats, Rising stars blog, fantasy draft, and calendar. 

This website include a home page and six other main pages. 
Four pages focused 
*volleyball
*Basketball
*Esports
*Track and field. 

The target audience that we are hoping to reach are children, young adults, seniors and elders. There is something for all sports lovers, and even someone is not particularly a sport lover they are still welcomed to our website. 

Since our website focuses on a selected nuber of sports our audience may be limited to fans of those 
sports in particular. Our mission is to provide a space where sports lover can come together in times of need and watch sports in a wide variety. 
To participate in fantasy leagues and meet other sports fans. The main colors of our home page will be red and gray. It will include our personalized logo in red at 
the top left-hand corner and bottom left-hand corner. The header will contain our website banner and our slogan.*

**I worked on the Track & field and ESports pages personally**
